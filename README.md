# Trello project!

This project is a clone of [Trello](https://trello.com/).
It uses Rails authentication, Backbone, Bootstrap and jQuery UI.

Models exist for `Boards`, `Lists`, and `Cards`. `Lists` and `Cards` have an
`ord` attribute that corresponds to the order they're shown in.
You can change the order of lists by dragging and dropping them.
